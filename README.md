# h5pandas : out-of-core pandas DataFrames with h5py.
h5pandas is a thin overlay on top of h5py that provides pandas DataFrames instead of h5py datasets.

The purpose of this library is to combine the power of Pandas' data manipulation with the efficiency of h5py and the HDF5 format.
It also has convenient methods to write DataFrames directly into an HDF5 file.

## FAQ

### Why should I use it ?
Opening a HDF5 file with h5pandas is extremely fast and is very low memory consumming !

Here is a small benchmark with a DataFrame containing 2.4GB of data splitted into 3000 Series.

### What can it do ?
With h5pandas can save pandas DataFrame into HDF5 files and read them very efficiently.

You can use h5pandas the same way you use h5py.
The main difference is that h5pandas gives pandas DataFrame objects instead of dataset objects, even if the file has not been written with h5pandas.
Once you have the dataFrame, it works exactly as any other pandas DataFrame.

### What is the difference with Pandas native HDF5 ?
Pandas already has a support for HDF5 files (with PyTables) but it requires to load all the data at
file opening and that can be very time and memory consuming for large dataset/DataFrame.

Instead, this library opens a file and create a Pandas DataFrame without actually reading the data.
The data are read only when needed, this behavior is called "out-of-core DataFrame".
It allows to open very huge files (even larger than memory) instantaneously and with a very memory footprint (less than 1 MB).

### How it works ?
Since pandas DataFrame are columnar we use h5py ability to save the data as vertical to chuncks.
This means we can read and extract each column individually without the others.

The particularity of these DataFrames is that they deeply rely on the underlying file object.
Each time a data is accessed it reads it from this file object.
That means you need to make sure the underlying file is never closed.

### When to use it ?
- When you have columnar data (Series).
- When you have huge datasets and only want to read a few columns.
- When you want to save a Dataframe into a HDF5 file.

### When not to use it ?
- If your data is scattered over thousands of small hdf5 files and you want to open them all.
- When your data are not columns and therefore they cannot be represented by series.

## Files compatibilty
h5pandas is fully compatible with h5py: you can write a dataset with one library and read with the other.

h5pandas is able to open HDF5 file written with :
- h5pandas
- h5py
- `pandas.to_hdf` if `format='fixed'` was used.

h5pandas is NOT able to open HDF5 files written with `pandas.to_hdf` if `format='table'` was used.
If a dataframe was written with h5py, columns names, indexes and attributes are lost but with h5pandas they are saved.

## Readthedoc
Full API documentation is still being written but a draft is available at : https://h5pandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Installation
```
pip install h5pandas
```

## Getting started

### Pandas compatibilty
For those familiar with pandas, the function `dataframe_to_hdf` is the easiest way to write a DataFrame into a HDF5.

#### Saving a file
```Python
import h5pandas as h5pd
import pandas as pd

df0 = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [0.09, 0.91, 0.23, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06],
        [0.85, 0.67, 0.17, 0.25, 0.19, 0.11],
        [0.92, 0.14, 0.52, 0.50, 0.43, 0.26],
        [0.47, 0.47, 0.48, 0.72, 0.71, 0.12],
        [0.05, 0.60, 0.12, 0.19, 0.20, 0.69],
        [0.08, 0.64, 0.31, 0.98, 0.63, 0.05],
        [0.74, 0.93, 0.76, 0.54, 0.03, 0.07],
        [0.79, 0.98, 0.51, 0.73, 0.13, 0.31],
    ],
    columns=["f", "o", "o", "ß", "a", "r"],
    index=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"],
)

# The function dataframe_to_hdf is the easiest way to write a DataFrame into a HDF5
h5pd.dataframe_to_hdf(df0, "foo.h5", "foo")
```

#### Reading a file
Later you can retrieve your DataFrame with exactly the same columns names, index and attributes.
You can use the DataFrame as any other other DataFrame.
However, since the data are not loaded into memory, you must make sure the file is always opened when you acess it.
```Python
with h5pd.File("foo.h5", "r") as file:
    df = file["bar"]
```

These DataFrames can operate with "classic" DataFrames
```Python
    delta = df - df0
```

### h5py API
Since h5pd is based on h5py, it has the same API.
Therefore you can use h5pandas the same way you use h5py except that it provides `pandas.DataFrame` instead of `h5py.dataset` objects, even if the file has not been written with h5pandas.

h5pandas is fully compatible with h5py: you can write a dataset with one library and read with the other indifferently.
However, h5py does not deal with indexes and attributes while h5pandas does.

#### Saving a file with h5py syntax
If you are more familiar with h5py syntax, you can write a DataFrame into a HDF5 file with `create_dataset`.

Inside the file, the columns names are saved as attribute of the dataset.

```Python
import h5pandas as h5pd
import pandas as pd

df0 = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [0.09, 0.91, 0.23, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06],
        [0.85, 0.67, 0.17, 0.25, 0.19, 0.11],
        [0.92, 0.14, 0.52, 0.50, 0.43, 0.26],
        [0.47, 0.47, 0.48, 0.72, 0.71, 0.12],
        [0.05, 0.60, 0.12, 0.19, 0.20, 0.69],
        [0.08, 0.64, 0.31, 0.98, 0.63, 0.05],
        [0.74, 0.93, 0.76, 0.54, 0.03, 0.07],
        [0.79, 0.98, 0.51, 0.73, 0.13, 0.31],
    ],
    columns=["f", "o", "o", "ß", "a", "r"],
    index=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"],
)

with h5pd.File("foo.h5", "a") as file:
    df = file.create_dataset("bar", data=df0)

```

If you already have a dataset from h5py you can convert it into a DataFrame with `dataset_to_dataframe`
```Python
with h5py.File("foo.h5", "r") as file:
    dataset = file["/bar"]
    df = h5pd.dataset_to_dataframe(dataset, ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "g"])

os.remove("foo.h5")
```

These DataFrames can operate with "classic" DataFrames
```Python
    delta = df - df0
```

With the "h5" accessor you can access to the file object, the name of the dataset, dataset object (h5py), dataset object (h5py)
```Python
    df.h5.file
    df.h5.name
    df.h5.dataset
    df.h5.attrs
```
