# h5pandas
h5pandas is thin overlay on top of h5py that provides pandas DataFrames instead of datasets.

You can use h5pandas the same way you use h5py except that it works with DataFrame.
The main difference is that h5pandas gives pandas DataFrame objects instead of dataset objects, even if the file has not been written with h5pandas.

h5pandas is fully compatible with h5py: you can write a dataset with one library and read with the other indifferently.
The only difference is that h5pandas provides DataFrames instead of datasets objects.

This library has been developed to combine the power of Pandas' data manipulation with the efficiency of h5py and the HDF5 format.
Pandas already has a support for HDF5 files but it requires to load all the data at
file opening which can be very time and memory consuming for large dataset/DataFrame.

Instead, this library opens a file and create a Pandas DataFrame without actually reading the data.
The data are read only when needed, this behavior is called "lazy DataFrame".
It allows to open very huge files (even larger than memory) instantaneously and with a very memory footprint (less than 1 MB).

The particularity of these DataFrames is that they deeply rely on the underlying file object
Each time a data is accessed it reads it from this file object.
That means you need to make sure the underlying file is never closed.

If you write a `pandas.DataFrame` with h5pandas, columns names, index and attributes will be saved in the file and can be retrieve later with h5pandas.
h5pandas is also able to open HDF5 file written with pandas.to_hdf if format='fixed' was used.

When to use h5pandas : 
- When you have huge datasets and only want to read a few columns
- When you want to save a Dataframe into a HDF5 file.

When not to use h5pandas : 
- When you actually want to read all the data into memory

df0 = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        [0.09, 0.91, 0.23, 0.01, 0.02, 0.06],
        [0.85, 0.67, 0.17, 0.25, 0.19, 0.11],
        [0.92, 0.14, 0.52, 0.50, 0.43, 0.26],
        [0.47, 0.47, 0.48, 0.72, 0.71, 0.12],
        [0.05, 0.60, 0.12, 0.19, 0.20, 0.69],
        [0.08, 0.64, 0.31, 0.98, 0.63, 0.05],
        [0.74, 0.93, 0.76, 0.54, 0.03, 0.07],

    ],
    columns=["f", "o", "o", "ÃŸ", "a", "r"],
    index=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"],
)

# The function dataframe_to_hdf5 is the easiest way to write a DataFrame into a HDF5
h5pd.dataframe_to_hdf5(df0, "foo.h5", "foo")

# If you are more familiar with h5py syntax, you can write a DataFrame into a HDF5 file with create_dataset
# Inside the file, the columns names are saved as attribute of the dataset.
with h5pd.File("foo.h5", "a") as file:
    df = file.create_dataset("bar", data=df0)

# Later you can retrieve your dataFrame with exactly the same columns names and index.
# If the data was written with h5py, columns names and indexes are lost.
with h5pd.File("foo.h5", "r") as file:
    df = file["bar"]

    # These DataFrames can operate with "classic" DataFrames
    delta = df - df0

    # With the "h5" accessor you can access to ...
    # The file
    df.h5.file
    # The name of the dataset
    df.h5.name
    # The dataset
    df.h5.dataset
    # The attributes
    df.h5.attrs

# If you already have a dataset from h5py you can convert it into a DataFrame with dataset_to_dataframe
with h5py.File("foo.h5", "r") as file:
    dataset = file["/bar"]
    df = h5pd.dataset_to_dataframe(dataset, ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "g"])

gc.collect()
os.remove("foo.h5")
```
